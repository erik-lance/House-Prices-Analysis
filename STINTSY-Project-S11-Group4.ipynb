    "The dataset contains house prices for King County which is located in the US State of Washington. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It is an IBM dataset that focused on predicting the prices of houses in the USA through analysis.\n",

    "In the realm of real estate and housing, the condition of a property plays a pivotal role in its market value. Understanding and accurately assessing the condition of houses is essential for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this need, we embark on a project aimed at classifying houses based on their condition. The condition of a house, graded on a scale of 1 to 5, serves as our target variable. This classification task will empower us to predict and differentiate houses based on their state of repair and maintenance."
