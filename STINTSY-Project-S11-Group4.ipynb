    "In the realm of real estate and housing, the condition of a property plays a pivotal role in its market value. Understanding and accurately assessing the condition of houses is essential for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals alike.\n",

    "To address this need, we embark on a project aimed at classifying houses based on their condition. The condition of a house, graded on a scale of 1 to 5, serves as our target variable. This classification task will empower us to predict and differentiate houses based on their state of repair and maintenance."

These were essential in determining patterns and nuances of our dataset, leading to better interpretation of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our findings, most houses are observed to be in average condition, reflecting a predominant grade of 7 for construction and design. Renovations are relatively infrequent, and the majority of houses cater to families with three bedrooms and two bathrooms. Notably, there's a common trend of a significant portion of the lot going unused, particularly in larger lots. In this way, we are able to understand the real estate ecosystem of King County's housing market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geospatial analysis highlights distinct patterns in house conditions across different regions of King County, emphasizing the influence of location. Cross-feature relationships reveal strong correlations between `sqft_above` and `sqft_living`, while `year_sold` and `month_sold` exhibit minimal correlation. From the high correlation, its a possibility that larger houses typically have more above-ground living space. \n",

This may be a factor in the model's performance. This may also be why 1 and 2 are never predicted correctly. This may be due to the fact that the model is not trained enough to predict the rare conditions.\n",
